# Intro. To Python For Machine Learning Graded Quiz

This repo contains the python codes for my graded quizzes.

Test 1(16-08-2021): Disappointed in myself for letting the timer throw me off balance :angry: and that resulted in silly errors :disappointed:.

It was a fun experience. Looking forward to the next challenge to improve :muscle:.
